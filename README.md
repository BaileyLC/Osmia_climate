# Osmia_climate

This repository contains protocols, metadata, sequencing reads, RDS files, and R scripts for the analysis of bacterial and fungal communities found in association with pollen provisions from the solitary mason bee, Osmia lignaria. We measured how simulated temperatures changed microbiome diversity and composition as well as bee development and health.
